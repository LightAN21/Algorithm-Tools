### Graph

A graph is a way to representing relationships that exist between pairs of objects.
That is, a ghrph is a graph G is simply a set V of objects, called vertices and a collection E of pairs of vertices from V, called edges.

Edges in a graph are either directed or undirected.
Notation: we use [u, v] to represent an edge of a graph.

### Undirected Graph
An undirected graph is a graph in which edges have no orientation.
The edge [u, v] is identical to the edge [v, u].

### Directed Graph
A directed graph(or digraph) is a graph in which edges have orientations.
The edge [u, v] represent a directed edge from node u to node v.

### Weighted Graph
A weighted graph is a graph in which each branch is given a numerical weight.
Notation: we use (u, v, w) to represent an edge [u, v] with weight w in weighted graph.
