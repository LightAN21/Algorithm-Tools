## Graph

A graph is a way to representing relationships that exist between pairs of objects.

That is, a ghrph is a graph G is simply a set V of objects, called vertices and a collection E of pairs of vertices from V, called edges.

Edges in a graph are either directed or undirected.

Notation: we use (u, v) to represent an edge of a graph.

### Undirected Graph
An undirected graph is a graph in which edges have no orientation.

The edge (u, v) is identical to the edge (v, u).

### Directed Graph
A directed graph(or digraph) is a graph in which edges have orientations.

The edge (u, v) represent a directed edge from node u to node v.

### Weighted Graph
A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge is given a numerical weight.

Notation: we use (u, v, w) to represent an edge (u, v) with weight w in weighted graph.

### path
A path is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges that starts at a vertex and ends at a vertex such that each edge is incident to its predecessor and successor vertex.

### cycle
A cycle is a path that the first node of the path corresponds to the last.

### directed path and directed cycle
A directed path is a path such that all edges are directed and are traversed along their direction.

A directed cycle is similarly defined.
